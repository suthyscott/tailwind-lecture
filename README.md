## Why Tailwind?
- Fast growing and one of the most popular styling libraries for React
- Excellent documentation
- Can be a bit of a learning curve, but is highly efficient once you're used to the utility classes. More on this once we start actually writing Tailwind.
- Tailwind is highly performant and reduces load times due to its JIT (just-in-time) method of generating CSS as it's needed.

## Installing Tailwind

Follow the docs for installation and setup instructions. 

### Tailwind config file

`content`. Point out how the config file is setup to find any JS or TS files in the `src` folder and apply any class found in them. 

`theme`. We'll use this later to define custom utility classes for our app. 

There are other config options, such as `plugins`, but we're not going to go into them here as they're more advanced topics. 

### How does tailwind work? 

Tailwind is designed around pre-built `utility classes`. These classes are written directly in your JSX in React components. 

But wait, isn't inline CSS super annoying and inefficient? Generally, yes. But tailwind is booming in popularity because of the following reasons:
- Using prebuilt classnames is much more readable and condensed than inline CSS
- Tailwind is highly consistent because every developer is using the same utility classes
- Along with being efficient and consistent, Tailwind is highly customizable and allows you as the developer to maintain full control of your styling. 

Demonstrate styling using Tailwind classes.
